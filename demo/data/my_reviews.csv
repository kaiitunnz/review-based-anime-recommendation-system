    Note: This is my 1st ever review so please bear wit me on dis. 
 
Today I am reviewing Tokumu Sentai Shinesman(Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman in America).Based on the Manga by Kaimu Tachibana,and Hideki Sonoda and directed by Shinya Sadamitsu. Character design by Akiharu Ishii 
video produced by Gakken,Aniplex Inc and Movic dubbed to english by Media Blasters. The video is based on the super sentai series of tokusatsu programmes.anyway as the story goes the king of the alien planet Voice has declared war on the planet Earth.However,their way of war is peculiar. the war of big business(I know it's weird but if I must say so the show is not ordinary itself and that's what makes it great). The plan is to send Prince Sasaki and stratieist,Seki to Earth to form a corporation big enough to take over the world. they plan on doing this by funding and marketing  a popular television series called &quot;Greatmen&quot; which is a power rangers type show. however planet earth fights back with a group of heros known as the shinesmen created by the Right Trading Company. The shinesman team is inspired by the superhero televison shows of the day, however the color of the costumes and weapons are just absurdly lame (I mean who has ever heard of a tie clip bomb or business card cutters). 
 
Each chararcter enterestingly enough is named after their original voice actors/actresses who performed their voices,many of whom are well known actors  in their field.  
 
The script of the show is pure genius. I must confess it had me laughing like crazy. The characters are well memorable and the animation is impressive. the only thing i have to complain about is oddly enough what the characters in the anime complain about themselves, what is it you ask? the colors of the costumes and the lame weapons. sure I know that red is a great color i must agree but who in the heck would run around in a sepia colored costume throwing tie clip bombs, TIE CLIP BOMBS. that aside there are even some pop culture references in the show from Godzilla to The artist formally known as Prince,the humor metor is pretty high and don't worry for those of you that like drama and even romance theres some of that too. 
 
Seriously the anime is so good i wish they would've more than 2 episodes. 
also last but not least the theme song is sung by none other than Hironobu Kageyama.who is famous for singing the themes to Chojin Sentai Jetman, Hikari Sentai Maskman,and Dengeki Sentaii Changeman. 
 
In my opinion this anime is one of many greats I've seen so far and I say if you are looking for something a little out there( who am i kidding almost all anime is kinda outhere and that's what makes it awesome). then check it out for yourself if you never seen it and if you seen it watch it again and again you won't be dissapointed. Until then this is Atatsukizero sayin LONG LIVE ANIME.

    Okay, Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou, let me just say, this was one of the few anime that I've completed within 2-3 days. It may not make my favorites but I did like it very much. 
 
Let's start with the story. As this is a slice of life the story could be summed up as the daily lives of those who live in Kawai Complex. The stories usually only encompass one episode but are highly entertaining and funny. 
 
As for the art.....Jesus Christ it's beautiful. This anime is a feast for the eyes. Some of the outfits that the characters wear are just gorgeous. At certain moments, what it does with lighting and coloring is just so pretty! It also has its characters go into chibi forms to better help with comedic moments. 
 
The Sound is....kinda good but not really impressive. For this aspect I primarily look at the openings and endings but it wasn't anything mind blowing. The song for the opening I kinda liked but how the visuals were set up didn't really impress me. The ending encapsulates the lives of the characters pretty well so that gives it more points in my book. All in all I preferred the ending theme to the opening one. As for background music, nothing really caught my attention. 
 
The characters in this show were quirky and very funny. Many jokes were repeated but don't  I feel annoyed about it. I found the characters quite likeable and though they didn't contain the depths of the ocean within them, they had enough personality not to be boring after awhile.  
 
As I said earlier, I enjoyed this series a lot and would watch it again.

    This show has laughs, mystery and a lot of heart.  
 
Astra probably isn't the best show set about people lost in space, but I do give it a giant A+ for effort when it comes to keeping me invested in the overall plot and mystery.  
 
The show follows a group of teens (and an elementary schooler) who get lost in space after a wormhole shows up on their field trip to another planet.  
 
Storywise I think this is where the anime most strongly stands, it has a bit of an episodic format to start off, but in the second half the episodes race (at a good speed) toward the conclusion, where not a single plot thread is left unanswered (the conclusion for this anime makes it seem like their ending off a 100+ episode series, and has a better conclusion than some of those anime). 
 
I think the first few episodes take a bit to get on their feet, (the episodic format of planet to planet and each characters tragic backstory not particularly interesting when you don't know the group) but where this anime really finds its footing is not in the space drama but in the mystery aspect that grows throughout. Where reveal after reveal takes your mind on a magic course, and you're second-guessing parts of earlier episodes, and wondering where each small hint leads as you theorize different elements.  
 
Art is typical but never distracting--artistically it's told with a letterbox 16:9 format, they sometimes break away from (like when showing space, which I found quite fascinating). Sound has some good tracks, but nothing stands out; often the opening is left behind to use that extra minute of screentime to parade more information in.  
 
Character-wise they all start out very generic tropes; the nice one, the nerd, the jock leader, the princess, the dark edgy one, etc-- except surprisingly they actually grow out of their tropes.  
An example is most of the characters don't appreciate Kanata (the leader, who proclaims to be captain) in the beginning, however, it involves to everyone having gained a respect for him after he recuses Aries in the first episode, and he's the heart that brings the team together. He evolves from they typical someone who ""must save everyone"" to having a reason for having this attitude than being a shounen protagonist-- and a reason to realize he's most suited to be the captain in the group, which is why he takes on the role.  
 
Most of the main cast grow out of their tropes as the series goes on, and in the last episode, there wasn't a single one of them I didn't like (whereas in the first episode I had much doubt about a few). Each character breaks away from what you presume them to be in at the start, truly giving the series an edge, and making me invested in what will happen.  
 
Honestly, this was a really fun series for the 12 episodes they had (the first and last of those episodes are 40 minutes, so really it's like 14 episodes!)  
 
I came in expecting a bland space team adventure, but in the end, I got to experience an unravelling (well paid off) mystery, and a conclusion that's written better than most 12 episodes series (and most anime in general) ever get.

    Alright before I get into this, this review most definitely represents the JoJo Franchise in it's entirety, as well as for Part 4 personally. JoJo to begin with, is something I could easily live for just to point that out. There are an infinite number of reasons why I say these words. Simply put the thrill and edge cutting uniqueness it packs, is INSANELY incredible. From character designs, color pallets, references, inventive world building, meaning/symbolism, culture, history, music, humor, mystery, and infinitely on....the JoJo Franchise is the embodiment of all these things. JoJo is literally everything. JoJo is the World itself, no puns. It is a international representation. It exhibits all aspects of the world, it's cultures and all it has to offer. This is why I say this. Araki is and ever beyond his time.  
 
Out of all Parts in the series, Part 4 is the perfect example of what the series is. No matter how much flack it gets. It represents what JoJo truly is and even demonstrates how it will continue to evolve into even greater. It assures that the viewer pays homage to the series previous parts and even accentuates their importance. It is heavily story driven, and even still with this task successfully blossoms with color, a sense of realism, detail, fantasy, fiction, sci-fi, brilliant stand battles, etc. It contains this seamless flow that is impossible to not enjoy. It introduces really well designed characters and stands such as Kira and Rohan, Terunosuke Miyamoto, or Echoes and Heaven's Door; which in my personal opinion are insanely genius works of Araki. Moreover, there is this sense of resourcefulness in every character that you begin to see appreciate as the story unfolds. This meticulousness that is somehow sensational. On top of all this, Araraki does what he does best---having the ability to take a basic concept and make it seem as if you've never seen it before, hence exotic. It's able to maintain this eccentric, thrilling, interesting demeanor so flawlessly. This is why JoJo is on a higher echelon of quality. This is what JoJo is and that's why there's truly nothing like it.

    Well some people shit on Bayblade but i think its fine this season was fun just because get many new charterers and for spinning top fights they are not that bad the main cast are a little boring and the final fight was not exciting and some of the love bale charterers from the first season are useless and just gone  
 
 
 Tsubasa kinda goes through and fighting your inner darkness story arc like Riku from Kingdom hearts. 
 
For fights they can be good or bad some times some one will win because plot says so. 
 
For villains they are ok the Garcia's had some back story and the the way the had to fight them was cool but they were over used later on Argo is the only one worth to say anything about. For team America the way the final rounds are done are cool. and the fights had so history behind them.   
 
 
 
 That is all i have to say if you like long running action kid shows like pokemon you might like this.

    i liked the characters,  
i enjoyed watching this anime because of them. 
but the relationship between the sisters is.. kind of unreal. 
(from personal experience) 
i love the thought of admiring your sister though,  
instead of gettting annoyed at her (which is more realistic) lol  
i loved watching this though, i though it was great, 
its reallly cute

    There were too many things done differently with this installation of Genshiken. So much to the point where in the end I was left with mixed feelings. 
 
After re-watching Genshiken (the originals) then coming back to Nidaime it's sort of like the new characters make the story a bit.... complicated so to speak. I mean personally, I'm okay with gays and transgender or BL (I have no issues with trans) however this series focused a bit way too much on Boys love, transgender, etc that I just couldn't enjoy it as much. I found it rather difficult to continue watching, however if it wasn't for the most of the original characters I would've just dropped it. 
 
A few things I liked was that the new characters, Mirei, Rika, etc they were tolerable. I like how after a few episodes they really blended in as part of the OG cast. Honestly, I would've been happier if the Nidaime focused more on Chika, however and again, to a certain extent the main focus was on Hato, the trap and Harunobu. I did like how towards the middle of the series I got to see Chika get the spotlight and all but still... 
 
The parodies. homages, easter eggs whatever you want to call them were great. I loved how they had little parodies of Bakemonogatari, Attack on Titan, Panty and Stocking and so much more. But my favorite of them all is the skit between Sue and Madarame because I like Bakemonogatari and my favorite skit in that show is the ""Oops I stuttered"" bit between Araragi and Mayoi. So seeing another show do it was like really funny. 
 
The soundtrack to the show wasn't really good to me. In fact, as i'm writing this, I can't even say if the music was any good or not. I did however love the voice acting. I really liked Yukana Nogami or Oono's seiyuu. It came as a bit of a surprise that she could speak English pretty well and I don't remember her ever using it in the other series. Madarame and Sue's voice actors were great too because again, the Bakemonogatari skit was so spot on. 
 
Lastly, I'd say that I enjoyed Nidaime just a little. Once again the sense of enjoyment I got from this series compared to the rest was a bit of a downgrade. However that didn't stop me from actually liking the show even if it was just a little bit. 
 
Overall I gave this show a 7/10 because while it was good in a sense, it just didn't seem like the story went in the right direction.

    *SPOILERS* 
Ok so doraemon was part of my childhood so watching this film feels so nostalgic about the good old days when i was a kid who would doraemon on tv everyday. 
The art and visuals are amazing to look at, so even though i knew the story, i still appreciated looking at the viusuals 
sound design was outstanding, really evokes emotion and feelings. 
Characters were also extremely in-character to their anime selves so it was good there too. 
The only gripe i had was the ending I didnt like it at all. Doraemon leaving was a tear-jerker and so ruining it by bringing him back to the present 10 mins later was so anti-climatic. i might have appreciated it more if this happened to adult nobita or nobita's son since it has been a while and nobita has grown and matured on his own and seeing his old friend after so many years would have been a great ending but having doraemon come back to present day nobita after so little time was annoying and a bad move 
So honestly it was a great movie and extremely nostalgic to watch and while the art sound and characters were on-point the ending kinda ruined the movie by removing the bitter-sweetness that would've given the movie a perfect end.

Manliness?! Pfft, get that out of the way! For an adorable show like K-On!, it's simply not needed. All I cared about is to be turned into a euphoric blob and I have to say, it's nice to not be a human every once in a while... 
 
Yep. So somehow, blob me is typing this right now. Don't mind the change though. I was fully prepared after becoming too affectionate with the show. After all, sweet besties are always a treat to watch. Whether that's having silly fun, eating yummy desserts together, or playing music. They laughed, I laughed. They smiled, I smiled. They lazed around, I lazed around. They're happy? I'm happy! Life doesn't always need dramatic events. I mean, have you had those rare moments when there were no panic and only relief? Like waking up thinking you're late for school or work but it was actually the holiday. Nice feeling isn't it, being able to relax? That same floaty sensation wrapped itself around this pure slice of life. Really, nothing much went on in the story. But that was exactly why the enjoyment worked. Nothing much happened, so the girls' different but equally childlike personalities can glow against what should've been a dull setting. They were such a likable bunch with great bonds and similar love for music. It's no wonder why I can't count how many times my jaw tires out from laughing because of their interactions. No wonder why my heart tires out after getting bombarded with tons of cuteness. Huh, no wonder why I turned into a blob. Life works in mysterious ways sometimes. 
 
But wait! I can't fully talk about cuteness without expressing the art. Yes, it was simple but blobby me liked it. Blobby me also thought the simplicity helped in defining the cuteness even further as too much details can be masking. Let's see here, the ingredients. Chubby face, big eyes, innocent expressions, adorable clothes. Ah, that's eyebleach right there! So sorry for any puppies and kittens and other cute animals out there. You guys are still great but this is a major competitor. My human self melted from all the warmth in the atmosphere. Even more with the animation. Dynamic and fluidity communicated with delightful consistency. Their reactive body mannerisms spoke emotions when words were not needed. Oh, and hello deformations! Other than the fact they looked like blob me, intended or not, I found that it emphasized the comedic nature of the characters really well so smiles turned into giggles. And when they spoke or chatter actually, you can describe the voice acting as endearing. Blissful pretty much every time. Not many background soundtracks but they didn't bogged down the fluffiness. Being characters from their own music club, the couple of songs they played on their concerts were nice to listen to. Seeing them enjoying themselves up on the stage always brought a smile to my blobby face. 
 
You know, watching a few episodes of K-On! at night in a soft bed with a fluffy blanket, I always slept feeling really happy. Blob or not, goofing around with an anime like this to distract you once in a while is really not a bad thing to conclude your day on a relaxing note.

    When compared to the first fma, it's more funny than dark, it has a lighter kind of humor and still remains serious. In a world of equivalent exchange we all know we've gotta give things up in order to gain things. Just like how I'm giving up time I could use for more productive things but I'm writing this review. Or how you'll give up all your time watching this awesome anime. The characters are great, there are many funny situations, and the animation is great along with the animation. The plot is wonderful and there isn't a boring moment in this show, there is also a lack of fillers so the awesome keeps on coming.

    Ano Hana is an emotional tale full of friendship, romance, and, in a lot of ways, redemption. It centers around a close group of childhood friends known as the ""Super Peace Busters"" who inevitably drift apart following the accidental death of one of their members. The group itself is made up of six members, each with an affectionate nickname, including: the hikkikomori Jinta Yadomi (""Jintan""), the rebel girl Naruko Anjou (""Anaru""), the arrogant playboy Atsumu Matsuyuki (""Yukiatsu""), the collected Chiriko Tsurumi (""Tsuruko""), the happy-go-lucky Tetsudo Hisakawa (""Poppo"") and the playful Meiko Honma (""Menma"") who died in the accident that one summer's day ten years ago.  
 
Each character's distinct personality and the interactions that each has with another create a nice balanced dynamic, much like a good group of friends should. Of course, these characters weren't always the way they are in the present day, and over the course of the series you'll see how Menma's death alters each character's present personality. All the character performances are great, but it's undeniable that Ai Kayano's performance as the eternal child Menma steals the show. While the character's effervescent voice can be hit-or-miss, it's a definite testament to the flexibility of a talented and underrated seiyuu.  
 
The narrative jumps between the day of Menma's accident and the present day (ten years after), slowly unraveling the events of that day and revealing why things ended up the way they did. Utilizing common elements of a mystery, like suppressed truths and hidden motives, Ano Hana makes you ask questions and does a pretty fantastic job of answering all of them at a reasonable pace that is guaranteed to keep you watching. 
 
With Ano Hana being a completely original work, A-1 Pictures had a lot of freedom with the animation, and they do not disappoint. Character designs are nice (they actually change clothes!) and there are plenty of details in each facial expression, which is essential for an emotional work like this. Something about the animation that struck me was the cinematic feel of it all. The shot types are varied, from beautiful shots of scenery to extreme close-ups of part of someone's face, and the camera actually moves around, making things feel a lot more alive and organic. 
 
The score successfully captures the nature of the entire series. It's playful, nostalgic, and even heartrending. From soft piano passages to gentle guitar plucks, the music helps connect the events and the characters from both the past and present. The ending song, ""Secret Base,"" is performed by the three lead female characters and typically plays over part of the last scene of each episode, adding a certain child-like feeling. This allows time to not only reflect on the episode, but our similar experiences as well. The opening song, ""Aoi Shiori,"" is one of my favorite songs of all time and perfectly fits the feel of the entire series: wistful at times, but ultimately hopeful. 
 
One of Ano Hana's shortcomings is that some of its melodrama can feel forced at times. However, the series definitely does a great job of utilizing comedic breaks to prevent the series from becoming overbearingly maudlin. Its main strength, I feel, is its ability to give layers of depth to each character in such a short amount of time (only 11 episodes). The preconception that you have for a character is often turned upon its head. It's a unique type of character development where their traits already exist; it just takes some trigger to pull back the layers that mask them. That catalyst happens to be Menma's reappearance, and the layers being the years that have passed since her death. It plays upon the idea of the importance of a single person's life and how profound of an impact she can have on everyone in her life. 
 
I don't know if I can recommend Ano Hana enough. It's more than an anime. It's an emotional experience that everyone can relate to. We all have friends, we all grow up, and we all experience loss. It's how we cope with these experiences that make us who we are, though. In Ano Hana, the dead feel alive, the alive feel dead, and it takes the reappearance of an old friend to remind the ""Super Peace Busters"" that friendship does not die so easily.

    Summary: Nisekoi is a more modern take on the harem genre. So if you find harem cringe, just stay away from this. If you're like me and love harem, this will definitely end up on your favorite anime of all time.   
 
Story: I don't usually like anime where people pretend to be lovers, but Nisekoi is the exception to the rule. Especially when the girl is a tsundere! The other characters like Onodera and Tachibana really add to the story and make the ""slice of life"" enjoyable to watch and very entertaining. 
8/10 
 
Art: The art style of this anime is something you just fall in love with. The character's movements and how the art conveys emotion are definitely what I look for in all anime. And of course the overall looks. 
9/10 
 
Sound: The soundtrack really suits the situations in this anime, which is a defining factor in whether many romance anime are good or not. Voice acting in this anime also really suits the characters. The lively characters in animation have a lively voice etc. 
9/10 
 
Characters: As I stated before I love tsundere. Chitoge Kirisaki is one of my favorite characters in this anime. The other characters like Raku and his harem also have great personalities. They are all unique and there is definitely controversy over who is ""best girl."" 
 
Enjoyment: Overall I really liked this anime and had a great time watching it. I can't wait for season two and am up to date with the manga. But until the GO TEAM CHITOGE. 
 
Overall 9/10

    Note: I may possibly be overrating this anime since it is the first one of it's type that I have watched. Take this into consideration before deciding if my review is helpful or not. 
 
Art (8/10) 
Just what you would expect from an anime in 2011. Nice detail and color used in virtually all scenes. With this being the first anime with guns that I have watched, I may have overrated the art a bit. Despite this, I truly do believe that the guns and bullets were animated quite well. The way they bounce off and hit objects looked real for the most part. Solid artwork overall.  
 
Characters (8/10) 
At first, I thought that the stars of the show were only going to be a loli tsundere female and a useless male protagonist. I'm glad that I was wrong. With the addition of a yandere (Shirayuki) and a kuudere (Reki), along with the seemingly bipolar Riko, I found the nice variety of personalities extremely interesting. For the most part, I found all the characters likable in one way or another. Yes, even a yandere like Shirayuki (whom I hate) had at least one good point in her character. With each of the aforementioned females having at least one episode that centered around them, the series became more interesting. Although they had limited screentime, I felt that the other side characters (Mutou and the rest of Assault) didn't get enough character development. However, I understand that since time restraints may have been the cause for this.  
 
Sound (7/10) 
This time, I'll focus on the voice acting first. With Kugimiya Rie and Majima Junji (Taiga and Ryuuji in Toradora!) pairing up once again, it felt a bit nostalgic when I heard Aria and Kinji speak. Aside from the excellent voice acting, the other sound aspects of this anime fell short. Although the OP and ED are not terrible, they are certainly not memorable. The BGM felt like it wasn't even present with the instrumental version of the OP being played at the most critical scenes. After accounting for all of this, the voice acting by itself wasn't able to impress me enough to increase my score for this category.  
 
Story (9/10) 
After reading the synopsis, I was given a brief idea of what this anime would be about. The idea of a loli twin-tailed tsundere wielding pistols and fighting against evil with the help of a ""sometimes skilled"" partner sounded generic but interesting. However, I was quite surprised at how the story developed. Yes, there were some really predictable and lame scenes but I was quite forgiving since this was my first time watching this type of anime. According to others, this adaption was done poorly but since I haven't read the LN yet, I'm basing my score on what I saw, regardless of what happens in the LN.  
 
Overall (8/10) 
A decent anime overall. Nothing too spectacular but it didn't bore me to death either. With a great variety of characters and a interesting story, I enjoyed watching Hidan no Aria. As for a second season, I don't really mind if there is going to be one or not. If there is, I will definitely watch it since this season met my expectations. The somewhat cliffhanger ending was a bit annoying though. If you got nothing better to do, just give Hidan no Aria a try. There's a chance that you may like it despite what many critics say about it.

    When a friend told me about this series i was like pfft this looks a little to similar to all the other non-stop shooters that i have seen,but my friend kept bugging me about it and i was like sure i'll watch it just so he would shut up about! then i watched it and was pleasantly thrilled to find out that there was more to it then just raging violence.it has a great plot,good storyline,interesting characters,and when i was done with it i was sad that there wasn't anymore to watch. but all in all i give it 5/5 and recommend it to anyone that likes to watch a anime and learn a lesson about life in it.

    This is an anime based off of a book, Daddy Long Legs, by Jean Webster. I'm a really big fan of the book, and when I found out that someone made an anime of the book, of course I had to see it! 
All-in-all, it's a pretty decent anime... if you're a big fan of the book. Judy is a little obnoxious at the beginning of the series and the actual story doesn't get really good until right about episode... 25 or so, I guess.  
But, if you can sit through all of Judy's obnoxious, embarrassing situations, then it's completely worth it. Especially for the ending!  
Also, having read the book, there were parts of the show that almost made it a comedy, because I knew already what was going on... but! Ah! Spoilers! 
 
To sum up... It's a decent enough older anime if you're a fan of the book. If you haven't read the book, go read it! Right now! And then come back and watch this anime!

    Like Lolis? Like guns? DO YOU LIKE SEEING A PINK LOLI MASSACRE PEOPLE WITH A MACHINE GUN AFFECTIONATELY NAMED P-CHAN? Then boy do I have an anime for you.  
 
On a serious note, you can't judge this one by its cover. The premise sucks unless you're really into lolis with guns. Yet there's something satisfying seeing a tiny pink thing make a fool out of larger more serious adults. Of note, this anime is primarily a comedy, borderlining parody of the original. The action scenes are well-executed,creative, and witty. And like I said, it's enjoyable watching LLENN outmaneuvering the other players.  
 
In terms of themes, forget the melodramatic die irl if you die from SAO. This is about the friendship between two women who shared nothing in common except for their love of gaming. If you've ever had a friend you used to game with online, and had a blast together, this is about that. The anime does a decent job of exploring online personas vs irl self. There's little room for character development, but it's short enough that development isn't really needed.  
 
This isn't an anime to be taken seriously. It's lighthearted fun and as long as you keep that in mind, it's a really enjoyable anime. 
 
 
Also, if you hated SAO, don't let that turn you away because I thought SAO was meh too and I really enjoyed this one. I wouldn't say it's one of the greats, but definitely recommend watching.

    Review on December 24th, 2015 
 
""Those who seek out the truth must not be arrogant. You must not laugh at miracles just because they cannot be explained scientifically. You must not turn away from the beauty of this world.""-Kotomi Ichinose 
 
Couldn't had said it better, Kotomi! Clannad is the prequel released before Clannad Afterstory, the anime that almost bought me to tears. Man, I knew I should had reviewed the first season first, because the second season has a Christmas episode. Oh well, mistakes will be made!  
 
From the distance: 
""GET ON WITH THE REVIEW KYUBEY!""-Kyou 
 
Ok ok...geez 
 
Plot:10/10 
Like the second season, the first explores the past of the characters in Clannad. Unlike the second season, the first explores the main character's past. Without spoilers, the most interesting one to me is Kotami's one. Of course, with these explorations, many emotions will be felt, and that's what makes this anime so good. You travel through people's past, whilst feeling what they are feeling. First season also has many of the things that made the second season so good. Unfortunately, I can't talk about it here, because the second season used spoilers from the first season. But either way, the second season delivered, and the first did as well! 
 
Characters: 9/10 
""Character development...character development everywhere!""-Buzz Lightyear 
First season went mad with the character development. Only a few didn't get it, however those got theirs on second season, so it solved that problem. I love the uniqueness between the characters. I also specifically enjoy this one character who I should not mention her name otherwise the parallel spoiler universe will appear and erase me from existence. BUT ANYWAY! The only actual flaw about this is that the main character is quite bland. I didn't mention this in Afterstory, because he wasn't as bland. But first season, he definitely is. To me, his actions are quite typical to the character he is suppose to me, and that isn't a good thing. However, even though with this flaw, the pros managed to get characters a 9 
 
Animation/sound: 9/10 
It was really hard to give this a 9. I loved the animation and art of this, it's stunning, it really is. However, ths sounds to me was just, good, and that's why I had given this a 9 
 
Opening/ending: 9/10 
Opening...is amazing. Extremely catchy, fits so well in the anime. It's just...amazing. Ending is good as well, but it doesn't really fit into this genre of anime, but was totally understandable on why they chose it. At least it's catchy and only brings opening/ending down to a 9. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
Same reasons on why I enjoyed Clannad Afterstory. Enjoyed going through the past, all the character development, opening/ending, and animation. Don't really need to expand on it again 
 
Overall: 47/50 
""Meow,""-Azura from K-on! 
Man, I am on a quote rampage this review! But to sum it all up, definitely watch the first and second season of Clannad. It is an excellent anime, and it will have you feel all the emotions God had given us. A must watch for everyone. 
 
After the review: One more to go! And I hope I can make an ice cream joke this time...

    Food Wars is a ridiculous show. The characters, the plot, the foodgasms, all of it is fucking ridiculous. That's what makes it fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously to be a buzzkill, but it's not stupid to the point of saccharine levels of cheese. There are serious moments and some very heartwarming moments. So, with that out of the way, let's talk about Season 2 of this ridiculous show. Because while it is more of the same, there is definite flaws that I can look at.  
 
Story: 7/10  
 
This seasons plot is basically a tournament plot and while it has some shining moments (specifically with Soma and Takumi), the pacing in this season is like speed-reading through a cook book: you get the basic idea, but the information you get doesn't simmer, so you just feel hollow by the end of it. It's a good arc, but I feel like the team that worked on this didn't really care. They jus blew past this arc without a care or worry and it losses a lot of it's impact. However, the season is saved by the last three episodes which probably contain some of my favorite moments of the show. So, while it does have a lot of good moments and the last three episodes are killer, the pacing is all over the place. 
 
Art: 6/10 
 
It's fine, like most J.C. Staff productions. It looks decent and there isn't really any shots I would say speak out or look different from each other. It's a bit of a downgrade from last season, but it's fine for what it is. The food looks amazing though. I love it. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
 
The Op for this season is exactly the type of goofy I excepted from this and it delivered exactly that. It's not as amazingly beautiful as the first op from the first season, but it does it's job well and the whole thing ending of the song is perfect. The ED is a bop though! The guitar, the vocals, the whole switching characters around taken from the OP but actually makes sense here.... god, I loved the ED from this one. it's probably the best from this show, by far.  
 
Besides that,  the music is still very good and while a little repetitive, it gets the job done and I enjoy still.  
 
Character: 7/10 
 
I'll just get this out of the way: I still love the characters from the season before and vice versa for the characters I don't like. This section is more about the characters that become less supporting and more of a main character this season. I'm just gonna list them down from best to worst: 
 
Ryo - He was in the first season, but he takes a shine this season and while it took me some time, I ended up loving him by the end because of his personality. He's a dude with a lot of anger and keep it all locked up in headband and while some of his dialogue is corny and edgelord-y, you slowly get the sense of the guy who is a very good chef but his cocky abrasiveness ruins his food. He's also a much more fascinating character when he doesn't have the bandanna on, personally. His backstory is a little too ridiculous, but when we find out about him and Alice, it's super sweet and shows some interesting dimension to Ryo. Easily the best character in this season. 
 
Suburu - This is the big new character to this season and his introduction is... alright. I think his super-obsession people's food and him just going one step above was... not scary, but made his come across as a really weird dude with too much time on his hands and honestly, if he was a real person, he would be in jail, but he's pretty funny and his backstory is actually really sad and kinda made feel for the guy. Plus, his food wars with Soma is really cool. 
 
Akira - I don't like this guy. Not because of spoiler reasons, but just his character in general. He's supposed to be another rival for Soma, but he just didn't come across as threatening or even interesting. He just comes across as another guy that doesn't really add to the season (besides the ending of the arc), nor does he remove anything to the series. He's just a bland character that I just found to be snobbish and uptight to everyone, even Jun on occasions. His backstory is sad, but it didn't really make me like the guy that much. He was probably the weakest character this season.  
 
If I added supporting, Alice's mom is hilarious and made me laugh on more then a couple of occasions. Overall, some good characters and one bad character. 
 
Enjoyment: 7/10 
 
It's basically the first season but faster paced and has more mellow moments then I thought. 
 
Overall: 7/10 
 
I actually didn't plan on making this review. I planned on binge watch all three seasons of Food Wars to get ready for the new season, but I realized that after this specific season, I could actually talk about a lot of things.  
 
There is a lot to like about this season and I love a lot of it, but there are some things that run a little hollow this season. I think the best example I can give is the character interactions between Soma.  Besides the main competitors, Soma interacts with Erina and Megumi, he doesn't really interact with many of the dormates more then once. I don't even think he interacts with Iishiki at all this season and it's purely for the rushed pacing. But it's still Food Wars and it's still pretty good.

    Just a warning  before watching NHK ni yokosou ( Welcome to NHK ) : you are going to fall in love with all the characters .. specially the lead one : Sato Tatsuhiro-dono ( as Misaki often calls him )  .  
 
the way this anime is evolving around  him is what makes this  show interesting : a diversity of characters that commmenly share with him being a failure in one or many sides  .. but also trying to undestand /change their lifes if possible .. that's why the story/character are outstanding , because in ' Welcome to NHK ' we are far from any SF contents or Heroic deeds  : it's the sweetness of  human beings struggling to live their lives as human as possible  with all their positive and negative aspects .. all wrapped in a good Chara design and specially an outstanding OST ( specially the guitar solo themes left me in awe ! ) ..  
 
In summary Welcome to NHK is a must-see anime !
